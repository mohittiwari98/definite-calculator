Features
User-friendly interface: Input any mathematical function in terms of x (e.g., x^2, sin(x), x*e^x).
Dynamic result calculation: Instantly compute the definite integral by specifying the integration limits.
Live graphing: Visualize the function and its area under the curve between the integration limits.
Responsive design: Works well across different screen sizes (mobile-friendly).

Technologies Used
HTML: Structure and layout of the application.
CSS: Styling and design for the user interface.
JavaScript: Calculation logic, integration computation, and dynamic user interaction.
Math.js (or other math library if used): To assist in mathematical calculations and parsing.


How to Use
Enter the Function: In the input box, type the mathematical function you want to integrate (e.g., x^2, sin(x), x^3 + 2*x).
Set Limits: Enter the lower and upper limits of integration.
Click 'Calculate': The definite integral result will appear immediately.
